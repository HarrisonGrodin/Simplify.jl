# Rewrite.jl
Modular algebraic reduction system

Term rewriting is essential to a wide variety of fields, including elementary, boolean, and abstract algebras. Because existing symbolic simplification tools in Julia typically operate within fixed domains, it is difficult to obtain a level of control which allows for flexible inclusion and exclusion of specific mathematical properties. Rewrite.jl is a new term rewriting library written in Julia that simplifies algebraic expressions based on custom, domain-specific axioms.
